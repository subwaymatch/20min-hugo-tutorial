Hi, I'm Park from Seoul, South Korea.

I like [writing code](https://github.com/subwaymatch). I started programming as a hobby in elementary school with Visual Basic. During my final year as an accounting major at the University of Illinois, I've made up my mind to pursue what I love to do. Thankfully, I was able to make the transition to the world of software through Samsung's recruiting program for non-engineers.

Fast-forward to 2020, I'm currently working as an instructor at the University of Illinois. I teach Data Analytics courses using Python and Tableau. My goal is to enhance the students' learning experiences using newer technologies.
